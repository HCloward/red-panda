		<h1>The Adorable Red Panda</h1>
		<p>The red panda (<i class="taxonomic">Ailurus fulgens</i>), also called the <b>lesser panda</b>, the <b>red bear-cat</b>, and the <b>red cat-bear</b>, is a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal">mammal</a> native to the eastern <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas">Himalayas</a> and southwestern China. It has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a waddling gait due to its shorter front legs, and is slightly larger than a domestic cat. It is arboreal, feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats eggs, birds, and insects. It is a solitary animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day.

		The red panda has been classified as <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endagered_species">Endangered</a> by the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature" title="International Union for Conservation of Nature">IUCN</a> because <strong>its wild population is estimated at less than 10,000 mature individuals</strong> and continues to decline due to <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction">habitat loss</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_fragmentation">fragmentation</a>, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaching">poaching</a>, and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbreeding_depression">inbreeding depression</a>, although red pandas are protected by national laws in their range countries.

		The red panda is the only living species of the genus <i class="genus">Ailurus</i> and the family <i class="family">Ailuridae</i>. It has been previously placed in the raccoon and bear families, but the results of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics">phylogenetic research</a> provide strong support for its taxonomic classification in its own family <i class="family">Ailuridae</i>, which along with the weasel, raccoon and skunk families is part of the superfamily <i class="superfamily">Musteloidea</i>. Two subspecies are recognized. <strong>It is not closely related to the giant panda</strong>.</p>
