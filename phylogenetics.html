                <h2>Ailuridae</h2>
                    <p>The taxonomic classification of the red panda has been controversial since it was discovered. French zoologist Frédéric Cuvier initially described the red panda in 1825, and classified it as a close relative of the raccoon (<i class="taxonomic">Procyonidae</i>), though he gave it the genus name <i class="genus">Ailurus</i>, (from Ancient Greek <i lang="el">αἴλουρος</i>, "cat"), based on superficial similarities with domestic cats. The specific epithet is the Latin adjective <i lang="la">fulgens</i>, "shining". At various times, it has been placed in the <i class="taxonomic">Procyonidae</i>, <i class="taxonomic">Ursidae</i>, with <i class="taxonomic">Ailuropoda</i> in the <i class="taxonomic">Ailuropodinae</i> (until this family was moved into the <i class="taxonomic">Ursidae</i>), and in its own family, the <i class="taxonomic">Ailuridae</i>. This uncertainty comes from difficulty in determining whether certain characteristics of <i class="taxonomic">Ailurus</i> are phylogenetically conservative or are derived and convergent with species of similar ecological habits.</p>
                    <p>Evidence based on the fossil record, serology, karyology, behavior, anatomy, and reproduction reflect closer affinities with <i class="taxonomic">Procyonidae</i> than <i class="taxonomic">Ursidae</i>. However, ecological and foraging specializations and distinct geographical distribution in relation to modern procyonids support classification in the separate family <i class="taxonomic">Ailuridae</i>.Recent molecular systematic DNA research also places the red panda into its own family, <i class="taxonomic">Ailuridae</i>, a part of the broad superfamily <i class="superfamily">Musteloidea</i> that also includes the skunk, raccoon, and weasel families.</p>
                    <blockquote>It is not a bear, nor closely related to the giant panda, nor a raccoon, nor a lineage of uncertain affinities. Rather it is a basal lineage of musteloid, with a long history of independence from its closest relatives (skunks, raccoons, and otters/weasels/badgers).— Flynn et al., Whence the Red Panda, p197</blockquote>
                    <p>The two subspecies are A. f. fulgens and A. f. styani. However, the name Ailurus fulgens refulgens is sometimes incorrectly used for A. f. styani. This stems from a lapsus made by Henri Milne-Edwards in his 1874 paper "Recherches pour servir à l'histoire naturelle des mammifères comprenant des considérations sur la classification de ces animaux", making A. f. refulgens a nomen nudum. The most recent edition of Mammal Species of the World still shows the subspecies as A. f. refulgens. This has been corrected in more recent works, including A guide to the Mammals of China and Handbook of the Mammals of the World, Volume 1: Carnivores.</p>

                <h2>Evolutionary History</h2>
                    <p>The red panda is considered a living fossil and only distantly related to the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), as it is naturally more closely related to the other members of the superfamily Musteloidea to which it belongs. The common ancestor of both pandas (which also was an ancestor for all living bears; pinnipeds like seals and walruses; and members of the family Musteloidea like weasels and otters) can be traced back to the Early Tertiary period tens of millions of years ago, with a wide distribution across Eurasia.</p>
                    <p>Fossils of the extinct red panda Parailurus anglicus have been unearthed from China in the east to Britain in the west. In 1977, a single tooth of Parailurus was discovered in the Pliocene Ringold Formation of Washington. This first North American record is almost identical to European specimens and indicates the immigration of this species from Asia. In 2004, a tooth from a red panda species never before recorded in North America was discovered at the Gray Fossil Site in Tennessee. The tooth dates from 4.5–7 million years ago. This species, described as Pristinailurus bristoli, indicates that a second, more primitive ailurine lineage inhabited North America during the Miocene. Cladistic analysis suggests that Parailurus and Ailurus are sister taxa. Additional fossils of Pristinailurus bristoli were discovered at the Gray Fossil Site in 2010 and in 2012. The frequency with which panda fossils are being found at Gray Fossil Site suggests the species played a large role in the overall ecosystem of the area.</p>
                    <p>The discovery in Spain of the postcranial remains of Simocyon batalleri, a Miocene relative to the red panda, supports a sister-group relationship between red pandas and bears. The discovery suggests the red panda's "false thumb" was an adaptation to arboreal locomotion — independent of the giant panda's adaptation to manipulate bamboo — one of the most dramatic cases of convergent evolution among vertebrates.</p>

                <h2>Taxonomic History</h2>
                    <p>The first known written record of the red panda occurs in a 13th-century Chinese scroll depicting a hunting scene between hunters and the red panda.</p>
                    <p>Major General Thomas Hardwicke’s 1821 presentation of an article titled "Description of a new Genus of the Class Mammalia,   from the Himalaya Chain of Hills Between Nepaul and the Snowy Mountains" at the Linnean Society in London is usually regarded as the moment the red panda became a bona fide species in Western science. Hardwicke proposed the name "wha" and explained: "It is frequently discovered by its loud cry or call, resembling the word ‘Wha’, often repeating the same: hence is derived one of the local names by which it is known. It is also called Chitwa." Hardwicke's paper was not published until 1827, by which time Frédéric Cuvier had published his description and a figure. Hardwicke's originally proposed taxonomic name was removed from the 1827 publication of his paper with his permission, and naming credit is now given to Cuvier.</p>
                    <p>Frédéric Cuvier had received the specimen he described from his brother's stepson, Alfred Duvaucel, who had sent it "from the mountains north of India". He was the first to use both the binomial name Ailurus fulgens and the vernacular name panda in his description of the species published in 1825 in Histoire naturelle des mammifères. Ailurus is adopted from the ancient Greek word αἴλουρος (ailouros), meaning "cat". The specific epithet fulgens is Latin for "shining, bright". Panda is the French name for the Roman goddess of peace and travellers, who was called upon before starting a difficult journey. Whether this is the origin of the French vernacular name panda remains uncertain. Later publications claim the name was adopted from a Himalayan language.</p>
                    <p>In 1847, Hodgson described a red panda under the name Ailurus ochraceus, of which Pocock concluded it represents the same type as Ailurus fulgens, since the description of the two agree very closely. He subordinated both types to the Himalayan red panda subspecies Ailurus fulgens fulgens.</p>
