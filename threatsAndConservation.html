            <h1>Threats and Conservation</h1>
            <section id="threats">
                <h2>Threats</h2>
                    <p>The primary threats to red pandas are direct harvest from the wild, live or dead, competition with domestic livestock resulting in habitat degradation, and deforestation resulting in habitat loss or fragmentation. The relative importance of these factors is different in each region, and is not well understood. For instance, in India, the biggest threat seems to be habitat loss followed by poaching, while in China, the biggest threat seems to be hunting and poaching. A 40% decrease in red panda populations has been reported in China over the last 50 years, and populations in western Himalayan areas are considered to be lower.</p>
                    <p>Deforestation can inhibit the spread of red pandas and exacerbate the natural population subdivision by topography and ecology, leading to severe fragmentation of the remaining wild population. Fewer than 40 animals in four separate groups share resources with humans in Nepal's Langtang National Park, where only 6% of 1,710 <abbr title="square kilometers">km2</abbr> (660 <abbr title="square miles">sq mi</abbr>) is preferred red panda habitat. Although direct competition for food with domestic livestock is not significant, livestock can depress bamboo growth by trampling.</p>
                    <p>Small groups of animals with little opportunity for exchange between them face the risk of inbreeding, decreased genetic diversity, and even extinction. In addition, clear-cutting for firewood or agriculture, including hillside terracing, removes old trees that provide maternal dens and decreases the ability of some species of bamboo to regenerate.</p>
                    <p>In south-west China, red pandas are hunted for their fur, especially for the highly valued bushy tails from which hats are produced. In these areas, the fur is often used for local cultural ceremonies. In weddings, the bridegroom traditionally carries the hide. The "good-luck charm" red panda-tail hats are also used by local newly-weds. This practice may be quite old, as the red panda seems to be depicted in a 13th-century Chinese pen-and-ink scroll showing a hunting scene. Little or no mention of the red panda is made in the culture and folklore of Nepal.</p>
                    <p>In the past, red pandas were captured and sold to zoos. Angela Glatston reported she had personally handled 350 red pandas in 17 years.</p>
                    <p>Due to <abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora">CITES</abbr>, this number has decreased substantially in recent years, but poaching continues, and red pandas are often sold to private collectors at exorbitant prices. In some parts of Nepal and India, red pandas are kept as pets.</p>
                    <p>The red panda has a naturally low birth rate (usually single or twin births per year), and a high death rate in the wild.</p>

                <h2>Conservation</h2>
                    <p>The red panda is listed in <abbr title="Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora">CITES</abbr> Appendix I. The species has been classified as endangered in the <abbr title="International Union for Conservation of Nature">IUCN</abbr> Red List since 2008 because the global population is estimated at about 10,000 individuals, with a decreasing population trend; only about half of the total area of potential habitat of 142,000 <abbr title="square kilometers">km2</abbr> (55,000 <abbr title="square miles">sq mi</abbr>) is actually being used by the species. Due to their shy and secretive nature, and their largely nocturnal habits, observation of red pandas is difficult. Therefore, population figures in the wild are determined by population density estimates and not direct counts.</p>
                    <p>Worldwide population estimates range from fewer than 2,500 to between 16,000 and 20,000 individuals. In 1999, the total population in China was estimated at between 3,000 and 7,000 individuals. In 2001, the wild population in India was estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000 individuals. Estimates for Nepal indicate only a few hundred individuals. No records from Bhutan or Burma exist.</p>
                    <p>Reliable population numbers are hard to find, partly because other animals have been mistaken for the red panda. For instance, one report from Burma stated that red pandas were still fairly common in some areas, and was accompanied by a photograph of a "red panda" as proof. The photograph in question depicted a species of civet.</p>
                    <p>The red panda is protected in all range countries, and hunting is illegal. Beyond this, conservation efforts are highly variable between countries:
                        <ul>
                            <li>China has 35 protected areas covering about 42.4% of red panda habitat.</li>
                            <li>India has 20 protected areas with known or possible red panda populations in Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, and West Bengal such as Khangchendzonga National Park, Namdapha National Park, and Singalila National Park, and a coordinated conservation policy for the red panda.</li>
                            <li>In Nepal, known populations occur in Langtang National Park, Sagarmatha National Park, Makalu Barun National Park, Rara National Park, Annapurna Conservation Area, Kanchenjunga Conservation Area, and in Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve.</li>
                            <li>Bhutan has five protected areas that support red panda populations.</li>
                            <li>Burma has 26 protected areas, of which at least one hosts red panda populations.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2>In situ Intiatives</h2>
                    <p>A community-managed forest in Ilam District of eastern Nepal is home to 15 red pandas which generate household income through tourism activities, including home stays. Villagers in the high-altitude areas of Arunachal Pradesh have formed the Pangchen Red Panda Conservation Alliance comprising five villages with a community-conserved forest area of 200 <abbr title="square kilometers">km2</abbr> (77 <abbr title="square miles">sq mi</abbr>)at an altitude of 2,500 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (8,200 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>) to over 4,000 <abbr title="meters">m</abbr> (13,000 <abbr title="feet">ft</abbr>).</p>

            <section id="captivity">
                <h2>In Captivity</h2>
                    <p>The red panda is quite adaptable to living in captivity, and is common in zoos worldwide. By 1992, more than 300 births had occurred in captivity, and more than 300 individuals lived in 85 institutions worldwide. By 2001, 182 individuals were in North American zoos alone. As of 2006, the international studbook listed more than 800 individuals in zoos and parks around the world. Of these, 511 individuals of subspecies A. f. fulgens were kept in 173 institutions and 306 individuals of subspecies <i class="taxonomic">A. f. styani</i> were kept in 81 institutions.</p>
                    <p>The international studbook is currently managed at the Rotterdam Zoo in the Netherlands. In cooperation with the International Red Panda Management Group, they coordinate the Species Survival Plan in North America, the European Endangered Species Programme in Europe, and other captive-breeding programs in Australia, India, Japan, and China. In 2009, Sarah Glass, curator of red pandas and special exhibits at the Knoxville Zoo in Knoxville, Tennessee, was appointed as coordinator for the North American Red Panda Species Survival Plan. The Knoxville Zoo has the largest number of captive red panda births in the Western Hemisphere (101 as of August 2011). Only the Rotterdam Zoo has had more captive births worldwide.</p>
                    <p>The Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park in Darjeeling, India, successfully released four captive-bred red pandas to the wild in August and November 2003.Three red panda cubs were born in captivity at Hamilton Zoo in New Zealand in December 2012, doubling the number held there.</p>
