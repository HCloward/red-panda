# red-panda
This repository was created as an assignment for the Modern Web Design course at The Gymnasium by Aquent.

My final goal for this course is to create a simple, multi-page website using content from a Wikipedia article as the source.

Lesson 1:

I created a new repo on my Github account and created a branch called gh-pages. Aftewards, I went to settings to make the repo a website using github pages. I now push all of my code to the gh-pages branch and when I go to this link I see my website: https://hcloward.github.io/red-panda/
I also selected the subject for my website, the red panda, one of my favorite animals at the zoo. I pulled all of my information from the wikipedia article here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda

Lesson 2:

For this lesson I took text from the wikipedia article on the red panda and started adding it to an html document. I began adding tags like html, head, body, and title. I also added some text-level semantics like i and b and a couple of links to other wikipedia articles. 

Lesson 3:

I added more content and created multiple html pages to store the content. I then created navigation links on my index.html page and connected all the different html pages. I also added images and put them all in the images folder. I added several sizes to account for different screen resolutions. 
   
Lesson 4:

For this lesson I added div elements to my document so that I could manipulate how the test appeared on the page. I centered the text so that it is easier to read. I also made the text bigger and added some weight to it. I added some color and moved my navigation links to the top of the page. I put my styles document in a css folder for easy reference.

Lesson 5:

I added some media queries to make my design reponsive. The navigation bar at the top disappears when the site reaches a certain size and leaves a hamburger icon at the top. Once tapped the icon reveals the navigation links. There really only needed to be one breakpoint between medium and small devices where the navigation links were getting a little jumbled. It was pretty challenging to figure out how to get the hamburger icon to show up properly, and determine the best break point. I also added a circle using an h3 element that I used as a back to top button and added background transitions to the navigation buttons.
